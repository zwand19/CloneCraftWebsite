## The Game Board

***

The game board is a **40 x 40** cell grid.

The bases are **3 by 3** and are placed in a random corner of the map, with 7 cells in between the base edge and corner of the map.
The (x,y) of a base is the top left corner of the base. These four possible coordinates are (8, 8), (30, 8), (30, 30), and (8, 30)

There are **30 gold resources** placed randomly and symmetrically **on each corner** of the board. These do not respawn once mined.

All gold will be placed **at least 3 cells from your base**.
