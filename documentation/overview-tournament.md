## The Tournament

***

####Clone Craft is the fourth installment of the Geneca Code Wars###

The day of the competition, the tournament was run as a double elimination tournament where each match was played as a best-of-5 series.
Congratulations to Jake Byrum for his 1st place entry, Fletcher Morrison for 2nd, and Michelangelo Scafidi/Cathy Brunsting for 3rd place.

For the first time in Code Wars history, we are holding an extended competition.

Any competitor can upload an implementation of their bot to our server and it will be added to the competition.

Every Sunday night at 10pm CT, we will run a round robin tournament where each entry plays each other entry in 4 games, 2 as player one and 2 as player two.

The game results, files to view games, and standings will be posted after each tournament is run.

While the tournament is being run, you cannot upload code or play the game.
