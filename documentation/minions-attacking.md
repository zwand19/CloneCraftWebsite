Minions can be allotted 1-5 stat points in both attack damage and attack range.

Minions have a base attack of 2 damage with a range of 2 cells. Each stat point increases those by 1.

Below is a picture of a minion with 2 stat points in both range and damage, giving it a range of 4 and damage of 4

Minions cannot attack and move or attack and mine in the same turn.

Minions can only attack one time per turn.

Be careful, minions **can** attack their fellow minions.

Attacking a resource or an empty space does nothing.

You can attack **any cell of a base**.

The attack command takes your minion's id and the x and y values of the coordinate you wish to attack.

**Beware, attacking an empty space or a resource will end your minion's turn**.
