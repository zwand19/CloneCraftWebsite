In addition to your base generating 5 gold per turn, you can also use your minions to retrieve resources and bring them to the base.

To mine a resource, move your minion either on top of a resource or to a cell directly bordering it. Then, run a mine command on the resource space.
After you mine the resource your minion will be carrying the gold, you must walk it back to a cell bordering your base in order to add it to your
base's gold total.

Once a resource is mined it is removed from the map and never respawns.

Minions cannot mine and move or mine and attack in the same turn.

Minions cannot mine if they are already carrying gold.

Minions **can** mine and hand off gold in the same turn (they cannot mine again that turn after handing off).

A minion's mining stat will determine how much gold they mine.

A minion's base mining is **20 gold per resource**, and increases by **8 per stat point**.

A minion with 1 stat point in mining gathers 28 gold per resource.

A minion with 10 stat points in mining gathers 100 gold per resource.
