## Minions

***

In order to win at CloneCraft you need minions to help you destroy the enemy base.

You will need them primarily to mine gold and attack your opponent's minions and base.

You can only have **15 minions on the board at a time**, and can only create one per turn.

Minions can be created in any cell adjacent to your base, **or any cell adjacent to one of your minions** (directly adjacent, not diagonally)

After a minion is created, it cannot be issued commands on that same turn.

There are two types of minions: "lesser minions" and "greater minions".

Lesser minions cost **50 gold** and can be allotted up to **10 stat points**.

Greater minions cost **100 gold** and can be alloted up to **19 stat points**.

Minion stat categories are attack range, attack damage, mining, speed, vision, and health.
Each minion must be allotted at least one stat point in each category.
