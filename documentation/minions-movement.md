Minions can only move in cardinal directions.

Per round, minions can move as many times as their speed.

Minions have a **base speed of 2**, and **every 2 stat points increases speed by 1**

A minion with 1 stat point has a speed of 2.

A minion with 2 stat points has a speed of 3.

A minion with 3 stat points has a speed of 3.

A minion with 4 stat points has a speed of 4... etc.

A minion with 10 (max) stat points in speed will have a speed of 7.

Minions can move over resources, empty spaces, and their own base. They can not move over other minions or an enemy base.

Failed move commands will not count against your speed.
