## Handing Off Gold

Minions can hand off all of their current gold to an allied minion at a cell directly adjacent to it (no diagonals).

There is no restriction on when a minion can hand off gold i.e. a minion can move, mine, or attack and hand off gold afterwards.

A minion **cannot** hand off gold to a minion that is already carrying gold.

If the minion being handed the gold is next to your base, the gold will automatically be deposited into the base.

A potential strategy is to have a slow miner out gathering resources and handing them off to a speedy minion to bring back to the base.

A hand off command takes in your two minion's ids.
