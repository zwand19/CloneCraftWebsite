## Game Basics

***

CloneCraft is played as a heads-up, turned-based strategy game. A view of the game can be seen below.

Each player starts with a base and **200 gold**.
The base can create minions. The minions can be alloted different stat points to give them different utility.
Minions can **move around**, **mine gold** and return it to the base, **hand off gold** to allied minions, or **attack enemy minions/bases**.

How you create/utilize these minions determines your success.

You win the game by destroying your opponents base. A game has a maximum length of **200 rounds**. If neither base is destroyed by then,
the tiebreakers are as follows:

1. Health remaining on base
2. Number of gold mined throughtout the match (not current gold)
3. If everything else is tied, the player who went second wins
