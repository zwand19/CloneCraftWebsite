## Playing The Game

***

The game UI is your main way of debugging your AI. It is simply meant to be used to test your engine and
was not designed with the intention of seeing if you can beat an AI, as playing with the UI gives you several advantages.

When creating a game, you have 4 options of player types:

- Human: issue commands yourself through the UI, good for getting a feel for the game as well as setting up your AI to react to different scenarios

- Current King AI: the submitted code that won the previous weeks Sunday tournament. Note: since their bot may be playing multiple games at a time, depending on the implementation their bot may not be as sharp as it is during the tournaments.

- Your local AI: issue AJAX requests against your local AI to do your testing/debugging. Your AI must be up and running on the correct port to start the game. This is the main way you will test your AI

- Your submitted AI: This will only show up if you are logged in. Play against your currently submitted bot. This is a good way to test that everything is up and running as expected before the Sunday tournaments

After tournaments are run, you can visit your profile page to download your game files. You can then load those files into the game page to watch them.
