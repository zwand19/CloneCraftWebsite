1. The header bar. Displays the current round, the gold in the current team's base, the number of minions owned by the current team, and the name of the current team.

2. The game panel. Depending on the type of game you are watching/playing these buttons will vary. Should be self explanatory.

3. A compass for those who are directionally challenged

4. Visible cells. These bright cells are all of the board that is within vision of your base and/or minions. Click on your base or minions to bring up the actions panel.

5. Hidden cells. These dark cells are not visible by any of your minions or your base. To see all of the cells, disable "Show Fog Of War" in the settings
